Aide is an AI-assisted, database-driven, multi-user Integrated Development Environment 
	in which Developers create software that is extemely useful to humans.
	Aide uses artificial intelligence throughout both project and product.
	Aide stores all project and product data into an AI-curated database, over the entire project lifecycle.
 	Aide extends to all stakeholders -- customers, managers, designers, analysts, programmers, testers --
	the enormous benfits of working in an IDE.
	Aide projects produce superior software products.
	
Aide vastly improves the efficiency of a software development project.
	Speed-up onboarding, reboarding, research, collaboration, production of each Developer's contribution.
	Improve productivity, motivation, morale, coherance, assignment accuracy and thoroughness...
	Improve schedule performance: get contributions done on time and to spec. 
	Improve quality of each contribution, esp. its accuracy, clarity, and accessibility.
	Reduce various organizational frictions like reporting and meetings.
	Avoid errors due to misunderstandings, oversites.
	Increase flexibility needed to deal with human and organizational contingencies -- accident, illness, crisis...
	Offload to AI mundane, repetitive, voluminous tasks like peripheral and exception codes, 
	resource management, db schemas and adapters, library and API facades...
	Offload to AI the production of unit, integration, contingency, and compliance tests
		 
Aide vastly improves the quality of the software produced by the project.
	Reliable. sourcecode written from near-perfect information is very-near-bug-free.
	Useful. Does what it's supposed to do, every time. Always stateful.
	Aide AI produces the product with several UXs, for different User scenarios,
	such as occassional, low-skill Users vs. frequent high-skill Users.
	Helpful. Helps Users of various skill levels, with help-information that is relevant and accurate.
	Flexible. Cooperates with macroes, demos, and other software.
	Satisfying, even pleasing. Always does what User would expect from 
	an intelligent, attentive, helpful interlocutor; never frustrates User.

Aide proposes that two things are most important:
	Accuracy and efficiency of information and communication
	Automation.
	
In Aide, information goes through a proccess of ADP:
	Acquisition, Disposition, and Presentation.
	
Acquisition
	Aide is of course an IDE. Developers tell Aide what they want it to do
	via commands: keyboard shortcut, menu selections, and natural language commands.
	We use the term "object" to be anything a developer can declare.
	Developers can input objects like sentences and paragraphs, using natural language.
	Developers can ask Aide to accept other objects: drawings, charts, tables, lists, pseudocodes, sourcecodes...
	
	In Aide, a specially-trained GPT (called STE-GPT) interviews humans,
	in order to convert their inputs into Simplified Technical English (STE).
	When a developer inputs a sentence, AI helps her to write the sentence in STE.
	When a developer inputs a paragraph, AI helps her to write the paragraph in STE.
	STE makes sentences and paragraphs accurate and easy to understand.
	STE makes sure every term/object in a sentence is carefully defined in the project database.
	STE makes sure that there exists only one name for each term/object.
	
	Another GPT helps developers name things: 
	terms, documents, document-parts, constants, variables, methods, classes...
	Standardized names are very helpful for human memory and relationships.
	
Disposition
	AI vets each object before putting it into the database.
	Is this object fundamental in the business logic?
	Is this object a peripheral, like a preference, setting etc?
	Is this object arbitrary, like an array or queue size, or max list length?
	Is this object required by an api or library?
	Is this object affect the UX, localization?
	Ensure consistency, completeness. timeliness. Avoid redundancy, ambiguity.
	AI builds graphs of relationships so that a developer can ask to see all related objects
	So that developer can refactor documents as well as code.
	
Presentation
	 Provide developer-specific reports so the various types of developers can do their jobs.
	 Go well beyond "paperless", to "just-in-time".
	 All project "documents" are composed just-in-time from the database, 
	 and tailored/condensed to particular developer(s).
	 The tailoring makes it easier for the developer to understand the document.
	 This greatly improves the signal-to-noise ratio of all project documents.
	 There cannot exist documents that are out-of-date.
	 Collaborators cannot run afoul of confusions and contradictions due to stale documents.
	 
IDE Workflows
	Aide integrates everyone into an IDE that provides them with job-specific tools.
	Provide communication tools so developers can collaborate.
	Developers will be able to communicate, coordinate, and collaborate as if in the current apps: Zoom, WhatsApp, Chat...
	Developers will be able to communicate with AI via natural language, drawings, paints, charts, tables, lists, pseudocodes, sourcecodes...
	Communicating with AI and with other Developers is actually adding/editing/organizing objects in the database.
	Aide creates reports from the database designed to educate and inform each developer
	what she needs to know in order to make her contribution to the project.
		
Aide provides extreme automation:
	 Almost all peripheral and exception code will be written by AI; none will be overlooked.
	 More workflows than ever before will  be automated, for accuracy, reliability, and efficiency.

In Aide, AI Writes All Peripheral Code
            In most programs, there's more peripheral code than core code. 
			Human programmers are terrible at peripheral code: 
			they put it off until later, then never get back to it. 
			It's boring, distracting; humans hate it. 
			AI doesn't get bored, tired, forgetful, distracted; 
			it's vastly more thorough at mundane tasks. 
			So Aide delegates peripheral code to AI.

            Performance Optimization
                    Caching, asynchronous operations.
            Testing and Debugging
                    Automated testing, debugging tools.
					
In Aide, AI Writes All Exception Code
    In general, Human programmers handle Exceptions better than Peripheral codes. 
	That's mainly because compilers enforce Exceptions and provide constructs like try, catch, throw...
	Yet, programmers often merely put a Log statement into the catch, or just throw the exception up a level. 
	This just defers dealing with it, and later the program does something foolish that frustrates and annoys User. 
	When we first roll out Aide, there will still be many exceptions to deal with, 
	because there will still be thousands of Human-coded libraries, SDKs, and APIs. 
	One of Aide's longer-term goals is to re-code them all with AI's help. 
	When that's done, most current exceptions will be a thing of the past.
 
	Resources such as RAM, local storage, Cloud storage will always be finite. 
	Resources such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, Internet may not always be available or reliable. 
	Handling exceptions related to these resource limitations and connectivity issues 
	is crucial for maintaining robust software.
 				
In Aide, AI codes several versions of user experience (UX)
	The database contains all the information needed to create several versions of the UX:
	more and less eye-candy, more and less business only.
	The database contains all the information needed to create various levels
	of user guides and context sensitive help. 
	These are guaranteed fresh because they're derived from the
	same data the program itself is derived from.
